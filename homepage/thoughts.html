		Reading #1: Hello World Wide Web
	</h1>
	<p>
		In Jenny Odell’s article, “How to Internet” she talks about the beginning of the internet era and how things have changed since then. When the internet was first introduced, enterprising individuals described the internet as a “superhighway." People imagined the internet as a place where you can travel and visit pages. As time went on, the internet began to develop its own culture and etiquette. For example, typing in all caps will make one sound like they’re yelling. Odell discusses the nostalgia she feels reflecting back on the random occurrences from exploring the internet. The idea of communicating with a real life person from across the world seemed miraculous and almost surreal. While the internet is able to connect people who are so far apart, this connection is not necessarily equivalent to real life interactions. It’s almost as if the internet has created a whole new culture of socialization.

			Laurel Schwulst’s article discusses what a website really is and the importance of having one. Websites are important resources for artists in particular because artists excel in creating worlds. Having a website would not only allow an artist to upload their work, but it would also allow for the artist to customize the entire atmosphere. Thus, websites serve as a powerful tool for individuals to express themselves and create an alternate reality for themselves/others to experience.

				Molly Soda’s interactive website mimics a giant collage with pictures from the internet that represent female empowerment. The variety and chaotic arrangement on her page gives a sense of intimacy and almost makes me feel as if I were in her bedroom. As Schwulst discussed in her article, websites are creations of unique aesthetics and atmospheres. Molly Soda’s page perfectly exemplifies Schwulst’s idea that websites serve as a portal into the artist’s world.

					In what ways do real life interactions differ from socializing via the internet? Why is it important for individuals to guide the web’s future rather than have corporations dominate the web? Based on Molly Soda’s website style and aesthetics, what can we infer about the goals of her site? How does the design of her site help communicate her message?

		Reading #2: Archive the Internet
	</h1>
	<p>
		Baladi speaks about the relationship between media expression and censorship from her experiences with the 25 January Revolution in Egypt. The revolution brought upon a fierce wave of media use and the implementation of art as activism. Although the uprising was also an expansion for creativity and gave way to a wave of self-expression amidst oppression, the suppression and concealment of such messages was also bolstered. Egypt began to increase surveillance, censorship and control on spaces of expression. Yet, the event stands as a moment of intense archiving, allowing much of the information recorded of the event to survive even now. The memory of such an event and other historical events will forever be preserved by remembering and interpreting the archives over and over again.

			Soulellis introduces urgentcraft, a series of tactics designed to combat oppression-based ideologies that are present in art and education. In a highly controversial political climate, he highlights the potential and efficacy of art and design to loosen power and bring about change. Though QUEER.ARCHIVE.WORK., URGENCYLAB, and other publishing efforts, he shares his efforts and observations regarding urgentcraft and gives us a better outlook regarding the future of art.

				When we archive historic work, who gets to tell the story? How can we preserve information in a way where history will not be misinterpreted or altered? How can social media be used to organize for change and rebel against censorship?

		Similarly to screenwriting, editing, and film production, computer science is a profession that is geared towards men. When women began to develop interest in computer science back in the 1950s, professional organizations were created to discourage the hiring of women. Thus, the percentage of women in computer science has fallen 17% by 2011.

			The origins of the Internet was created for military purposes and was built to withstand nuclear attack. It was designed as a solution to the vulnerability of the military's centralized system of control during the Cold War.

				As users of the Internet, we hold the power of shaping it. We can control the traffic of certain websites, determining the site's success and future. Thus, it is not corporations but rather individuals who are capable of shaping the network on the Internet.

					A common misconception of the Internet is that it is a cloud. In reality, the Internet is simply a wire buried under the ground. A server is a special computer connected directly to the Internet and web pages are files on that server's hard drives. Every hard drive has an IP address which allows computers to find each other. Home computers are called clients because they are connected indirectly to the internet through an internet service provider. Whenever information is transmitted through the web, the internet breaks the information into smaller pieces called packets. When the information reaches its destination, the packets are reassembled in their original order.

		Reading #3: Interface
	</h1>
	<p>
		“Black Gooey Universe” discusses the rise of technology in the Silicon Valley. As institutionalized anti-blackness has been ingrained in American society since slavery, it is no suprise that Silicon Valley perpetuates this anti-blackness through its technological products and processes. The normalization of artificial white screens as default screens for computers is both a metaphor for erasure of blackness and a literal instance of possessing white power through technology with the intent of universal application. The creation of the GUI consolidated all interfacing methods into a single screen, keyboard, and mouse, reducing movements of textual characters and bytes of data into icons. The GUI was a significant development both technologically and socially, as it allowed users to process the neutrality of white screens and the anti-blackness of technology.

			In “Rich User Experience, UX and Desktopization of War,” Olia Lialina talks about the history of interface design. Although scripting interactions were far less sophisticated in the early era of the web, it was far more interesting and expressive than what is available today. With the rise of UX, the familiarity with HCI terms is continuously declining. The role of “experience” in UX is to hide programmability and minimize the users’ interactions with the system. However, by scripting the user, this suppresses decision making and forces the users’ behavior to align with a specific path. Lialina also discusses the harms of gamifying war. As augmented reality merges with virtual reality, it allows pilots to mask traumatic imagery and become desensitized to violence. Thus, although simplifying interface activity provides for a more aesthetically pleasing experience, Lialina argues that the mental manipulation is not worth these changes.

				Similarly to the favor for white screens over black screens, in what ways do social media algorithms perpetuate the oppression of minorities and certain groups of people? Are elements such as dislike buttons more harmful because they create negativity on the Internet or do they allow for freedom of expression? In what other ways do we merge augmented reality with virtual reality and how is that harmful for us?
