		Reading #1: Hello World Wide Web
	</h1>
	<p>
		In Jenny Odell’s article, “How to Internet” she talks about the beginning of the internet era and how things have changed since then. When the internet was first introduced, enterprising individuals described the internet as a “superhighway." People imagined the internet as a place where you can travel and visit pages. As time went on, the internet began to develop its own culture and etiquette. For example, typing in all caps will make one sound like they’re yelling. Odell discusses the nostalgia she feels reflecting back on the random occurrences from exploring the internet. The idea of communicating with a real life person from across the world seemed miraculous and almost surreal. While the internet is able to connect people who are so far apart, this connection is not necessarily equivalent to real life interactions. It’s almost as if the internet has created a whole new culture of socialization.

			Laurel Schwulst’s article discusses what a website really is and the importance of having one. Websites are important resources for artists in particular because artists excel in creating worlds. Having a website would not only allow an artist to upload their work, but it would also allow for the artist to customize the entire atmosphere. Thus, websites serve as a powerful tool for individuals to express themselves and create an alternate reality for themselves/others to experience.

				Molly Soda’s interactive website mimics a giant collage with pictures from the internet that represent female empowerment. The variety and chaotic arrangement on her page gives a sense of intimacy and almost makes me feel as if I were in her bedroom. As Schwulst discussed in her article, websites are creations of unique aesthetics and atmospheres. Molly Soda’s page perfectly exemplifies Schwulst’s idea that websites serve as a portal into the artist’s world. 
			</p>
				<p>
					In what ways do real life interactions differ from socializing via the internet? Why is it important for individuals to guide the web’s future rather than have corporations dominate the web? Based on Molly Soda’s website style and aesthetics, what can we infer about the goals of her site? How does the design of her site help communicate her message?

		Reading #2: Archive the Internet
	</h1>
	<p>
		Baladi speaks about the relationship between media expression and censorship from her experiences with the 25 January Revolution in Egypt. The revolution brought upon a fierce wave of media use and the implementation of art as activism. Although the uprising was also an expansion for creativity and gave way to a wave of self-expression amidst oppression, the suppression and concealment of such messages was also bolstered. Egypt began to increase surveillance, censorship and control on spaces of expression. Yet, the event stands as a moment of intense archiving, allowing much of the information recorded of the event to survive even now. The memory of such an event and other historical events will forever be preserved by remembering and interpreting the archives over and over again.

			Soulellis introduces urgentcraft, a series of tactics designed to combat oppression-based ideologies that are present in art and education. In a highly controversial political climate, he highlights the potential and efficacy of art and design to loosen power and bring about change. Though QUEER.ARCHIVE.WORK., URGENCYLAB, and other publishing efforts, he shares his efforts and observations regarding urgentcraft and gives us a better outlook regarding the future of art.

				When we archive historic work, who gets to tell the story? How can we preserve information in a way where history will not be misinterpreted or altered? How can social media be used to organize for change and rebel against censorship?

		Hello World Wide Web Lecture Reflection
	</h1>
	<p>
		Similarly to screenwriting, editing, and film production, computer science is a profession that is geared towards men. When women began to develop interest in computer science back in the 1950s, professional organizations were created to discourage the hiring of women. Thus, the percentage of women in computer science has fallen 17% by 2011.

			The origins of the Internet was created for military purposes and was built to withstand nuclear attack. It was designed as a solution to the vulnerability of the military's centralized system of control during the Cold War.

				As users of the Internet, we hold the power of shaping it. We can control the traffic of certain websites, determining the site's success and future. Thus, it is not corporations but rather individuals who are capable of shaping the network on the Internet.

					A common misconception of the Internet is that it is a cloud. In reality, the Internet is simply a wire buried under the ground. A server is a special computer connected directly to the Internet and web pages are files on that server's hard drives. Every hard drive has an IP address which allows computers to find each other. Home computers are called clients because they are connected indirectly to the internet through an internet service provider. Whenever information is transmitted through the web, the internet breaks the information into smaller pieces called packets. When the information reaches its destination, the packets are reassembled in their original order.

		Reading #3: Interface
	</h1>
	<p>
		“Black Gooey Universe” discusses the rise of technology in the Silicon Valley. As institutionalized anti-blackness has been ingrained in American society since slavery, it is no suprise that Silicon Valley perpetuates this anti-blackness through its technological products and processes. The normalization of artificial white screens as default screens for computers is both a metaphor for erasure of blackness and a literal instance of possessing white power through technology with the intent of universal application. The creation of the GUI consolidated all interfacing methods into a single screen, keyboard, and mouse, reducing movements of textual characters and bytes of data into icons. The GUI was a significant development both technologically and socially, as it allowed users to process the neutrality of white screens and the anti-blackness of technology.

			In “Rich User Experience, UX and Desktopization of War,” Olia Lialina talks about the history of interface design. Although scripting interactions were far less sophisticated in the early era of the web, it was far more interesting and expressive than what is available today. With the rise of UX, the familiarity with HCI terms is continuously declining. The role of “experience” in UX is to hide programmability and minimize the users’ interactions with the system. However, by scripting the user, this suppresses decision making and forces the users’ behavior to align with a specific path. Lialina also discusses the harms of gamifying war. As augmented reality merges with virtual reality, it allows pilots to mask traumatic imagery and become desensitized to violence. Thus, although simplifying interface activity provides for a more aesthetically pleasing experience, Lialina argues that the mental manipulation is not worth these changes.

				Similarly to the favor for white screens over black screens, in what ways do social media algorithms perpetuate the oppression of minorities and certain groups of people? Are elements such as dislike buttons more harmful because they create negativity on the Internet or do they allow for freedom of expression? In what other ways do we merge augmented reality with virtual reality and how is that harmful for us?

		Reading #4: Meme and Poor Image
	</h1>
	<p>
		An Xiao Mina discusses the impact of internet memes on today’s political climate. Because memes are shared, aggregated, remixed, and circulated more widely across platforms, they serve as an important tool for spreading awareness and garnering public attention. Mina talks about how memes intersect with larger media discourses, such as how they are applicable to social movements. Although the networks of memes never reach a moment of stability, this constant change allows for remixes and different narratives.

			Rosa Menkman argues that Glitch studies “attempts to balance nonsense and knowledge.” While Menkman discusses glitches in a technological aspect, there is also a social perspective. Regardless, glitches should be celebrated rather than fixed, as they act as a sort of “new language” and go against the inherent norms, presumption and expectations of a language.
		</p>
			<p> Hito Steyerl talks about the symbolism of poor images and how they actually reflect reality. Images can come in many different forms, whether it's a JPEG photograph or a series of moving pictures on screen. While high resolution images are more brilliant and impressive, Steyerl argues that “Imperfect Cinema” can be just as technically and artistically empowering. Imperfect cinema blurs the distinction between the audience and the author. In a sense, it helps merge the divisions of labor within class society. 
			</p>
				<p>
					Are memes similar to political cartoons in the sense that they combine humour with darker political issues? How have memes changed over the years? Do you think the constant desire for better resolution will ever stop? As the aesthetic of glitches are making a comeback in today’s trends, do you think this will last? Or will we soon return to the desire for perfection?

		Reading #5: Machine Oppression
	</h1>
	<p>
		In Joy Buolamwini’s Ted Talk, she demonstrates how her face could not be detected by a facial analysis software. Because the people who coded the algorithm did not consider different skin colors and non-caucasian facial features, the facial analysis software did not recognize Joy, who is Black. Algorithmic biases, which are often used by police, are discriminatory against people of color. Thus, people who code such algorithms affect all of us as their internal biases become implicit in their code. By creating full spectrum teams with diverse individuals who can check each other’s blind spots, algorithms are less likely to employ exclusionary practices and develop unfair systems. In Mimi Onuoha’s talk, she discusses the data collection process through her work. Her projects, including “Pathways,” demonstrate how people can be represented through data and what information we can learn from this. In “Afro-now-ism,” Stephanie Dinkins discusses how modern technology (AI, biotech, gene editing, etc.) is inherently discriminatory and contributes to systemic racism. As artificially intelligent systems and algorithms continue to integrate into our everyday lives, we need to confront the biases that they implicitly create. Through education and active resistance against systemic oppression, it is our job to ensure that the relationship between technology and mankind is distributed equally.

		<p>
			Are there any features from Apple/Android devices that demonstrate racial discrimination?
			To what extent is data collection an invasion of privacy? How can we prevent systemic racism in algorithms and technologies?

		Reading #6: Data Heal & Digital Decolonization
	</h1>
	<p>
		Morehshin Allhyari recognizes the differences between physical bans against toys (and those that are part of western culture) and unnoticed censorship that occurs frequently online. She highlights the degree of normalization that each “ban” or “censorship” has in the world and encourages others to better comprehend the role that online censorship plays. Yaa Addae addresses the issues of data trauma and data healing, referencing the deep degree of influence the internet has over society and the potential issues and flaws within it (like the hidden hints and evidence that supports white supremacy). Not only does she promote the existence of such biases, but also advocates the continuous questioning and editing of our own social media. 
		Olivia McKayla Ross moves forward and talks about the use of p5.js and its effect on the digital world and technology. Ross explains the importance of analyzing and considering a series of questions that can be asked to better appreciate and honor certain individuals and groups, to give its regard to humanity in its connection with technology. 

	</p>
		<p>			
		What role does online censorship play? To what extent should we sacrifice our freedom of speech in the digital world for protection from hate? What are some ways we can honor certain  groups and communities through technology?

		Reading #7: Algorithmic Resistance
	</h1>
	<p>
		Ari Melenciano, a creative technologist and designer, discusses her project “Omni-Specialized Design for Beautiful Futures”. She talks about how as a designer, we should be creating with the people rather than FOR people. Melenciano also discusses circular design and circular economy where nothing is wasted in production. As the earth is not built for solely humans, we must not create boundaries between human and nonhuman. Rather than focusing on human-centered design, we should be focusing on ecologically-centered design and practice inclusion of all other life forms. In Tate Ryan-Mosley and Jennifer Strong’s article, they discuss Hamid Khan’s Stop LAPD Spying Coalition. Khan’s organization works for advocacy against predictive policing. As many policemen target specific groups called “persons of interest” or “habitual offenders” based on their own biases and algorithms, this results in a disproportionate amount of police brutality against that group. Because the police system was found on the basis of racism and will never not be discriminatory, Khan argues for the police force to be dismantled. Audre Lorde discusses how feminism is often exclusive and lacks intersectionality. Specifically, the absence of lesbian consciousness or consciousness of Third World women leaves a gap within discourses of feminism and justice. In addition, Lorde talks about how it is the task for women of Color to educate white women because white women rarely consider intersectionality when advocating for feminism. 

	</p>
		<p>			
		What are some human-centered designs that are involved in our everyday lives and how can we implement more ecologically-centered technologies from a day-to-day basis? Do you agree with Khan’s view that there is no such thing as “kinder, gentler racism” or do you think the police force can be reformed so that discriminatory practices are eliminated? What are some examples in the media of exclusionary feminism?

		<a href="https://newart.city/show/eat-me">Virtual Field Trip</a>
	</h1>
	<p>
		This interactive digital site by Alice Yuan Zhang led me into a virtual digestive sequence. I felt like I was a piece of food being consumed by somebody. Using WASD and my mouse, I navigated my way around the digestive tract. As I traveled down, words appeared along with narration of the words by a soothing voice. When I reached the end, I saw floating green bubble-like objects that spelled out the words “eat me” and the transcript of the narration. Overall, the experience felt tranquil yet visually mesmerizing at the same time. feminism.
