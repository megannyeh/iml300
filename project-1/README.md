[A Day in the Life of Ayumi](https://megannyeh.github.io/iml300/iml-300-project-1-hypernarrative/) is an interactive web experience that allows users to click and choose a non-linear storyline from the perspective of my dog, Ayumi. 

### Description

Based on Ayumi's real life experience, this narrative is a cute and lighthearted game that promotes the deeper topic of animal adoption. The first page introduces Ayumi and provides some context behind the narrative. To navigate the site, the user can click on the underlined text to bring them to the next page. Because each page provides different paths to progress the story, each user will have a different experience in reaching the final page. At the end of the narrative, there is a link that takes the viewer to a page that has more information on rescuing Taiwan dogs. I hope my site encourages people to adopt/rescue rather than purchase pets and demonstrates the love that these dogs can bring for your family!!! 
	As an avid video game enthusiast, my graphics and gifs were inspired by Stardew Valley and Minecraft. I wanted to use pixel art because I thought the cute and lighthearted style would contrast well with the more serious subject behind my site. Also, I felt that the pixel art would make my site appear more like a video game. In addition, I chose backgrounds that were from a sunset/pastel color palette to keep my site happy and vibrant. All of the adventures in the story are based on Ayumiâ€™s real life interests and favorite activities as I wanted to keep my site unique to Ayumi.
